      The planned structure of the Hellenic Navy starting from 2030 includes at
      least 4 corvettes. For almost a year, companies from around the world have
      been offering proposals for the Hellenic Navy to aquire 4-6 corvettes.
      These countries include France, the UK, the Netherlands, and Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the requirements of the Hellenic Navy was the ability to build at
      least 2 ships in Greece. Others include having at least 16 VLS cells on
      each ship, 2 20mm or more RWS, a modern AESA radar, ECM and a solid ASW
      suite, possibly including the CAPTAS-4 sonar.

    <h4>French proposal</h4>
    <p>
      Naval Group is offering the Gowind 2500HN corvette, witch focues on ASW
      while being adequately armed for AAW and ASuW as well.
    </p>
    <h4>UK proposal</h4>
    <p>
      Babcock is proposing the Type 31 frigate modified to serve as a corvette.
    </p>
    <h4>Netherlands proposal</h4>
    <p>Damen Group offers the SIGMA 10514HN corvette.</p>
    <h4>Italy proposal</h4>
    <p>
      Fincantieri is proposing the Doha-class corvette. Despite being the most
      expensive proposal out of the 4, it also completely lacks ASW
      capabilities.
