      The Hydra-class frigate of the Hellenic Navy has been and will be the
      backbone of it's fleet for at least 10 more years. The navy has an ongoing
      project to modernize the ships so they can increase their survivability
      and lethality in the modern battlefield. As of June 2022, the US and
      France have submitted proposals to the Hellenic Navy for the modernization
      of 4 ships.
    </p>
    <h4>US proposal</h4>
    <p class="mb-0">
      On December 10 2021, the State Department officially made a proposal for
      the modernization of 4 Hydra-class frigates. This proposal includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>8 Phalanx BLK 1B Baseline 2 upgrade kits</li>
      <li>4 Mk45, 5” gun overhauls</li>
      <li>4 Mk49 Guided Missile Launcher Systems</li>
      <li>4 COMBATSS-21 Combat Management Systems</li>
      <li>4 AN/SQS-56 Sonar overhauls</li>
      <li>8 Narwhal 20A 20mm RWS</li>
      <li>
        Sylena MK 2 Decoy Launching System with CANTO torpedo countermeasures
      </li>
      <li>TRS-4D Radar</li>
      <li>Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5</li>
      <li>NIXIE SLQ-25 Surface Ship Torpedo Defense System</li>
      <li>Helicopter Handling System (Repairs)</li>
      <li>Defense Advance GPS Receiver (DAGR)</li>
      <li>Gun Computer System (GCS)</li>
      <li>Low Frequency Active Towed Sonar (LFATS)</li>
      <li>
        Compact Low Frequency Active Passive Variable Depth Sonar-2 (CAPTAS-2)
      </li>
      <li>Infrared Search & Track System (IRST)</li>
      <li>
        Elta Electronic Warfare (EW) with C-ESM, R-ESM, and ECM capability
      </li>
      <li>Naval Laser- Warning System (NLWS)</li>
      <li>7 meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB)</li>
      <li>SQQ-89 ASW System</li>
      <li>Fire Control Radar System</li>
      <li>Link 16 communications equipment</li>
      <li>
        Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES)
      </li>
      <li>AN/SRQ-4 Tactical Common Datalink (TCDL)</li>
      <li>Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J)</li>
      <li>Air Defense Systems Integrator (ADSI)</li>
      <li>cryptographic equipment including SY-150, SY-117G, and KYV-5M</li>
      <li>general upgrade of the electronics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, this is a solid proposal, offering much needed upgrades such as
      an AESA radar, ECM, CAPTAS-2 Sonar and modern CIWS at a cost of $2.5
      billion. The primary contractors are Raytheon, Waltham, Lockheed Martin
      and BAE Systems.
    </p>
    <h4>French proposal</h4>
    <p class="mb-0">
      We don't know much about the French proposal since there has not been any
      official press releases. Despite that, it's certain that this proposal
      will include at least:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>8 Phalanx BLK 1B Baseline 2 upgrade kits</li>
      <li>4 Mk45, 5” gun overhauls</li>
      <li>Narwhal 20A 20mm RWS</li>
      <li>NS110/200 Radar</li>
      <li>STIR 1.2 Mk2 Fire Control Radar</li>
      <li>Altesse-H C-ESM/COMINT</li>
      <li>Sentinel R-ESM</li>
      <li>Nettuno-4100 R-EMC</li>
      <li>Infrared Search & Track System (IRST)</li>
      <li>
        Compact Low Frequency Active Passive Variable Depth Sonar-2 (CAPTAS-2)
      </li>
      <li>Kingklip Mk2 Hull Mounted Sonar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although the price is unknown at the time, we can assume that it will be
      less that $2.5 billion, since it offers less than the US proposal. If the
      Hellenic Navy chooses it, there will be a further discount because it will
      part of a larger contract including 4 FDI-HN frigates and possibly 4-6
      Gowind 2500HN corvettes. With all that said, this modernization
      proposition is still solid, again offering an AESA radar, CAPTAS-2 Sonar,
      ECM and RWS.
